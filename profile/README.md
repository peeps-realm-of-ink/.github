<h2>Purpose of Realm of Ink</h2>
<p><strong>Realm of Ink</strong> is an ink-style action roguelite developed by <strong>Leap Studio</strong> (with Maple Leaf Studio) and published by <strong>663 Games</strong>. It immerses the player in a stylized Eastern-fantasy world where the main heroine, Red the Swordswoman, gradually uncovers that she and all inhabitants are fictional characters within a book - and must fight against preordained fate. The game aims to blend action, RPG and roguelite elements with distinctive visual art and deep customisation systems.
</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ink-style Art & Aesthetic</strong>: The visuals combine hand-drawn or ink-painting–inspired art with modern 2.5D/side-view action design, giving the game a unique, stylized look across all stages - from Buddhist forests to enchanted kingdoms and ancient ruins.</li>
  <li><strong>Action Roguelite Gameplay</strong>: Fluid combat system, variety of weapons and character forms, build customization through Ink Gems, perks, and evolving pets.</li>
  <li><strong>Ink Gems & Builds</strong>: A wide array of Ink Gems (e.g. Tiger Ink, Venom Ink, Curse Ink, Dragon Ink etc.) that empower skills and define combat styles. Players can experiment with many combinations for replayability.</li>
  <li><strong>Ink Pets Companion System</strong>: Players can acquire and evolve Ink Pets that fight alongside them, offering extra abilities and strategic depth.</li>
  <li><strong>Procedurally Generated / Roguelite Structure</strong>: Each run offers different layouts, treasures, builds - encouraging replay and experimentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Mythology & Narrative with Metafiction Twist</strong>: The story revolves around a "Book Spirit" and the idea that characters are living within a book - exploring themes of fate, identity and free will.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Aspects</h2>
<p>What sets Realm of Ink apart is its ink-style Eastern-fantasy art direction, combining classical ink-painting or brush-style aesthetics with modern action-roguelite mechanics. The fusion of Ink Gems, pets, and build customization gives a level of depth and replayability uncommon in simpler indie action titles. The metafictional narrative - characters realizing they are written in a book - adds a philosophical layer to the action and keeps thematic interest beyond combat.
</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Realm of Ink is aimed at players who enjoy action roguelites, stylized art games, Eastern-fantasy aesthetics or mythological themes, and those who appreciate replayability through varied builds and customization. It appeals to fans of challenging combat, indie games with artistic direction, and players seeking a blend of RPG depth and fast-paced action.

<h2>Considerations & Known Issues</h2>
<p>Because Realm of Ink is still in Early Access (as of its PC release), some features are planned but not yet implemented. Content updates, balance patches, and expansion (additional characters, environments, combat options) are on the roadmap, but final release may change certain aspects.</p>
<p>Players should expect possible bugs or technical issues typical of EA games, and performance may vary depending on hardware, though requirements are modest. Also, because the game uses a stylized visual style and niche mythological themes, it may not appeal to those expecting mainstream AAA graphics or conventional fantasy settings. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Realm of Ink offers a fresh blend of action-roguelite gameplay, deep build customization, pet-based mechanics, and a unique ink-style art aesthetic rooted in Eastern fantasy. Its roguelite structure and build variety give high replay value, while the narrative concept of characters fighting against their predestined fate adds thematic depth. For players who enjoy indie action games, stylized art, and custom builds with replayability, Realm of Ink presents a compelling, creative experience - especially during its Early Access period. </p>
